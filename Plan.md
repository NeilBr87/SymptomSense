# SymptomSense - Plan

1. Design a basic, single symptom day tracker as an array that gets added to by a spread operator every time someone someone clicks new day.
2. Set the name as standardised after the first day but allow description/notes to be changed.
3. Incorporate dates - set a date for the first day then have it increment by one day every time someone clicks new day.
4. Add a backend - Supabase? to set a login and create for each user
5. Multi symptom tracker - add a button to add a new symptom to the array

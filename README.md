# SymptomSense

As a person with moderate health anxiety, one thing that's been a major coping mechanism for me in the last few years is keeping notes about a symptom that's been bothering me. If I keep thorough notes, I'll either be drawn to one of two outcomes:

- "This isn't really as bad as I think, it's getting better and I haven't had it as long as I thought," or
- "I have had this for a while and it's getting worse, might be worth taking a trip to the GP."

SymptomSense, as an app, has three objectives for me:

- Provide a simple, user friendly way to store these entries
- Give me more experience in some areas where I consider myself still quite new:
  - Array mapping in React
  - Authentication
  - Database integration per user
 - Create a full-stack app myself that is useful and provides a solution to a problem.

## Status 

This app is in development. The status is as follows:

**Frontend interface and tracker functionality** - âœ…  
**Authentication - login and signup (Firebase)** - âœ…  
**Deployment** - âœ…  
**Backend integration - logging tracker entries per logged-in user** - ðŸŸ   
**Multiple symptoms tracked** - ðŸŸ   
**Date tracker** - ðŸŸ 

## Guide

The app is relatively simple to use:

1. Login or signup. You'll be directed to the tracker area
2. Add a new day. On day 1, you'll be prompted to enter the symptom's name and notes. After that, the name will lock in and you'll only be prompted for the notes.
3. The notes is a free-text entry but you're encouraged to note things like whether the symptom took place today, how bad it was, and anything else to note.
